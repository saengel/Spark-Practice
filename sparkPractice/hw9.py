# QUESTION:
# The number of unique donors who gave individual donations of $10000 or more
# but didnâ€™t give any donation of $1000 or less.

# STRATEGY
# Map to unique name and donation
#
# SET ONE:
# Make one filtered set of those who gave 10000 or more
# Then map again just to name
# and distinctify = set of unique 10000 or more donors
#
# SET TW0:
# Make one filtered set of those who gave 1000 or less 
# Then map again just to name                        
# and distinctify = set of unique less than 1000 donors
#
# Make an intersection of the two sets
# And count - those are the people who we're disqualifying
# from our first set
# Count SET ONE and subtract our intersection = TOTAL
# (People who gave over 10000) - (People who also gave less than 1000) =
# Total: People who only gave over 10000

# Mapper
